				<h4><b>A. COURSE DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
				<p>Welcome to client-side web development! This course will cover the skills and techniques necessary for creating effective, dynamic, and responsive web applications that meet user needs. Through a variety of challenges, students will learn best practices for developing mobile-friendly web pages. Individual and group assignments will not only help develop skills, but will help students create a portfolio of their work. Upon completing this course, students will be able to build robust web applications, and will have the foundation for independently learning new web development skills.</p></br>
				<h4><b>B. COURSE OBJECTIVES</b></h4>
				<p>This course will teach you how to build sophisticated web sites and web applications. It focuses on the client-side languages, tools, and libraries that professionals use to build the web sites and applications you use every day. We will learn not only the basic syntax and mechanics of web development, but also the best practices that separate professional developers from amateurs.
					We've designed this course so that it should be challenging to beginners as well as those who already know a bit about web programming. The course is fast-paced and our expectations are high, but we will make sure that everyone, including the total beginners, are prepared to succeed. If you already have some experience, most assignments include optional requirements that give you the opportunity to learn more advanced techniques, libraries, and tools. These advanced requirements will also earn you extra-credit points, but don't let that be your primary motivation. You're here to learn in a safe and helpful space, so take advantage of it.</p></br>
				<h4><b>C. GRADING</b></h4>
				<p>Students earn points by completing challenges thoroughly and on time. While the first set of challenges is rather straightforward, students will need to stretch their technical skills and creativity to receive full credit on later challenges. The maximum number of points a student can earn on any challenge will decrease by 10% each day after the deadline. After 5 days, students may receive up to 50% credit on a late submission. This is to encourage the timely completion of challenges. If you have extenuating circumstances and cannot complete an assignment on time, please let us know in advance. Peer reviews of work on the group project will also contribute to your final grade.</p></br>
				<h4><b>D. CHALLENGES</b></h4>
				<p>Because of the ever-changing nature of web development, the purpose of this course is for students to learn how to teach themselves new tools (rather than learn a pre-defined set of skills). To accomplish this, students are expected to complete a series of challenges that assess their progress throughout the course. Lectures provide the necessary foundational information that enables students to seek out solutions for challenges. As the course progresses, students will have an increasing amount of flexibility with the challenges. This culminates with a self-directed group project in which students have the freedom to explore the elements of web development that they find most intriguing and important. Challenges are due before class on the scheduled date, unless otherwise indicated.</p></br>
				<h4><b>E. OPEN-SOURCE</b></h4>
				<p>One of the best things about client-side web development is that it's (largely) open source. During this course, you will both learn from and contribute to the open source community. In cases that you use code that you did not write, you must include a reference to where you found the code (a URL is fine). For example, there are lots of code skeletons for creating interactive visualizations on the web. It's fine to use these, just be honest about it. For independent assignments, feel free to work with your fellow students to think through challenging tasks. However, each student's assignment should be significantly different from that of other students. If there is any suspicion of plagiarism, there will be notable consequences both within the context of this course and in the University at large. If you have any questions about the appropriateness of using open source code or working together, don't hesitate to ask.</p>
